### Network Topology Architectures ###

## 1. Two-Tier Architecture 
    - Structure: Has access and distribution layers
    - Used for: Small to medium-sized networks 
    - Function:
      - Access layer connects end-user devices 
      - Distribution layer aggregates access switches and provides routing 
      - Simple and cost-effective, but limited scalability 

## 2. Three-Tier Architecture 
    - Structure: Has access, Distribution, and Core Layers
    - Used for: Large enterprise networks 
    - Function:
      - Core layes handles high-spead backbone connectivity 
      - Distribution manages routing, policies
      - Access connects endpoints 
    - Highly scalable ,modular, and resilient 

## 3. Spine-Leaf Architecture 
    - Structure: Modern data center topology 
    - Used for: Core switches, Leaf : access switches
    - Function:
      - Each leaf switch connects to every spine switch
      - PRovides low-latency, high bandwidth, and scalable traffic flow 
    - supports east-west traffic (server-to-server)

## 4.WAN [Wide Area Network]
    - Structure: Connects multiple LANs across geographically distant locations
    - Used for: Branch offices, rmote users
    - Examples:MPLS, VPNs , SD-WAN
    - Enables long-distance communication over public/private links

## 5. SOHO [Small office/Home Office]
    - Structure: Small, simplified network
    - Used for:  Home users, freelancers, small teams 
    - Devices: Often combines router, switch, firewall, and wireless AP in one box 
    - Easy to set up but limited in scale and features 

## 6. On-Premises and Cloud [Hybrid]
    - Structure: Combines local [on-premises] infrastructure with cloud services
    - Used for: Organizations wanting flexiblity and scalability 
    - EX:
      - On-prem servers + cloud storage
      - Hybrid identity systems
    - 	Offers cost savings, redundancy, and business continuity
