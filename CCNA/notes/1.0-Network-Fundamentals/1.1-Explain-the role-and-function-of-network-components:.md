## NETRWOEK COMPONENTS

# ROUTER 
    - Connects multiple networks together
    - chooses the best path for data using IP addresses
    - common in both LAN and WAN environments 

# Switch 
    - Connects devices within the same local network 
    - Forwards frames using MAC addresses 
    - supports VLANs and reduces network collisions 

# Firewall 
    - Fillters network traffic based on security rules 
    - Protects against unauthorized access and attacks 
    - Can operate up to Layer 7 for deep inspection 
  
# Access Point [AP]
    - Provides wireless access to a wired network 
    - Acts as a bridge for wireless devices 
    - Often used in enterprise WI-FI setups 

# Modem 
    - Connects the internal network to the internet via ISP 
    - Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa 
    - usually used in home network 

# NIC [Network Interface Card]
    - Allows a device to connect to a network 
    - Has a unique MAC address and operaates at Layer 1 and 2

# Server 
    - Provides services like web, file sharing, or DNS to clients 
    - Centralized resource in networks 

# Client 
    - End-user device that consumes services 
    - Sends requests to servers over the network 

# Hub [legacy device]
    - Broadcasts data to all connected devices
    - Works at L1,no intelligence-replaced by switches

# Bridge [legacy]
    - Connects two LAN segments and filters traffic 
    - Works at L2, similar to a basic switch 

# Load Balabcer 
    - Distributes traffic across multiple servers
    - Improves performance and ensure service availablity
