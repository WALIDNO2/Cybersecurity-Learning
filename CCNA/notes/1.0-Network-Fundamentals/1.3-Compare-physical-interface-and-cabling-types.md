# Compare physical interface and cabling Types 

### WHAT THIS TOPIC EXPLAIN 
this topic compares fiber optic and copper cables, and discusses Ethernet media types, including shared media vs point-to-point connections

## Fiber Optic Cables

### Single-Mode Fiber [SMF]
- Core: 8â€“10 microns
- Light: Laser
- Distance: long [up to 100+ km]
- Color: yellow [blue connectors]
- Use: Long-distance, WANs, ISP backbone 
- Benefit: High speed, long range

### Multimode Fiber [MMF]
- Core: 50-62.5 microns 
- Light: LED
- Distance: short [up to 550 m]
- Color: Orange/Aqua 
- Use: LANs, data centers
- Benefit: Signal dispersion at long range

## Copper Cables 

### Twisted Pair [UTP/STP]
- Cat5e/6/6a/7
- Connector: RJ-45
- Distance: 100m
- STP used in noisy environments
- Cheap and easy to deploy

### Coaxial [Legacy]
- Used in older networks and ISP lines
- Being replaced by twisted pair and fiber

## Ethernet Topologies

### Shared Media
- Uses hubs
- All devices share collision domain
- Half-duplex, CSMA/CD required
- Low performance, high collisions

### Point-to-Point
- Uses switches
- Full-duplex
- One collision domain per port
- Efficient, modern design
