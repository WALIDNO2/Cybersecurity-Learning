# Identify Interface and Cable Issues

## 1. Collisions
- Occur when two devices send at once on half-duplex
- Common with hubs or old setups
- Detected using: (show interfaces)
- Symptoms: slow performance, retransmissions

## 2. Errors

### Input Errors
- All receive-side issues
- Includes CRC, runts, giants, overruns

### CRC Errors
- Frame data corrupted
- Often caused by:
  - Bad cable
  - Interference
  - Duplex mismatch

### Runts/Giants
- Runt: < 64 bytes (often from collisions)
- Giant: > 1518 bytes (MTU/NIC issues)

### Late Collisions
- After first 64 bytes
- Caused by:
  - Long cables
  - Duplex mismatch

## 3. Duplex Mismatch
- One side full, other side half
- Symptoms:
  - Late collisions
  - CRC errors
  - Poor throughput
- Fix:
  - Use auto-negotiation on both ends
  - Or set same duplex manually

## 4. Speed Mismatch
- Interfaces set to different speeds
- Can cause:
  - Link down
  - Unstable connection
- Fix:
  - Set both sides to same speed
  - Prefer auto-negotiation

## COMMEND FOR TROUBSHOTING
```bash
show interfaces
show interfaces status
show running-config interface X/X
``` 
# NOTE SHORT COMMEND 
```bash 
sh int 
sh int status 
sh run int X/X
```
